Hi! I'm a software engineer at [Duolingo](http://www.duolingo.com/), where I've written (or rewritten) the flagship apps for web and Windows, the [DET](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/) web app, and the API backend. Now I lead Android and web development. Previously I graduated from the University of Virginia at 19 with majors in CS and math. More in [résumé](/files/ArtChaidarun-WebResume.pdf).

I spend my spare time playing guitar and piano, reading, hacking on personal projects, and writing the very occasional blog post. Currently in Pittsburgh.
